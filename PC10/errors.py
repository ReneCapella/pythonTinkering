# Write some test code that has bugs.
# Try to generate at least 5 different types of exceptions with your test code.
# (You can comment out sections of the code to allow generating just one exception at a time.
# Leave different versions of the error-generating code in the comments. You will need this later.)
#
# Once you have at least 5 different types of exceptions, rewrite the code with "try ... except"
# to allow the code to execute cleanly. Use multiple "except" clauses as needed.
# Submit your corrected code to this Canvas Dropbox.
