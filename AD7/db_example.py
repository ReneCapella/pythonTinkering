# With Python and SQLite -

# Create a test database.
# Create a table in the test database.
# Add some records to the table.
# Search the table for a specific record.
# Update a record in the table.
# Delete a record from the table.

# As a deliverable for this assignment, screen shots and/or text file copies of
# the queries above will be enough. If you get the proper query results, I will
# assume your Python code is working well. (For troubleshooting requests, please
# also upload the code!)
